# Escape the Haunted Manor!
You’ve woken up in a house you don’t recognize that is filled with strange objects and a ghostly atmosphere. Escape the manor before you are cursed to spend eternity here!

## Environment
The escape room map is an original design of a haunted manor. The details of the map are designed to add to the game’s spooky theme and create an immersive atmosphere. The music box, paintings, picture frames, and music box lock puzzle models are original creations. A custom golden shader is applied to the key, adding a unique, visual element that draws attention to this item. Particle effects enhance the fireplaces and the key, adding life to the environment. A custom blue light flicker is applied to the lights to add a spooky effect to the light.

## Puzzles (SPOILERS!)
1. Match the paintings to the correct frame.
   - Use either hand’s side trigger to grab the paintings and move them to their corresponding frame
2. Unlock the music box lock
   - Move to the teleport point by the music box, close to the bed
   - Use the side trigger to select which hand to track
   - Point the back trigger at the two rings and rotate them so the lights both turn green
3. Use the ouija board to locate the final key
   - Use the back trigger to select the board which activates the path to the key
   - Use back trigger to select the key

## Game Elements
There is a 10 minute timer that leads to a fail state. Complete all 3 puzzles to win.

## Movement
Use the teleport points on the floor to move by aiming at them and pushing the thumbstick forward and releasing. We chose this method to reduce simulator sickness for the user while still allowing them the ability to explore the map.

## Presence
Other than visuals, we focused on having audio senses that enhance the experience. The background stormy audio creates an eerie atmosphere while the crackle of the fireplace adds life to the environment. Completing each puzzle triggers an unlocking sound to let the player know they are a step closer to escape. The music box puzzle triggers a tune after completion.

## Development Process
Developing this escape room game was a challenge for the whole team, as we didn’t have prior experience designing a full game in Unity. On our first meeting, we had a lot of ideas that ended up not making the cut due to time constraints or being too complicated. For example, the original idea for the ouija board puzzle was for it to be more interactive where the user could ask a question using voice or text input which would have a unique response. However, we ended up simplifying it quite a lot. If we had more time we would like to flesh out the puzzle mechanics, add more storytelling elements, add collectibles/achievements, add co-op, and add more sensory feedback (haptic). Although our game is a simplified version of our original idea, I still think it provides a very fun experience.
